Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles , methods and tools to the development and maintainance of the system
importance of software engineering in technology industry is that it helps create software applications and systems that helps in various aspects such as communication, healthcare and entertainment

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming 
it was developed around 1960s to 1970s
Due to chaotic and error-prone nature of early programming languages, it led to emergence of structural programming
There was difficult to maintain and error-riden code due to software being written in a linear and unstructured manner
The structured programming used control structures(loops, conditions) instead of relying on "goto" statement and these made code easier to read understand and maintain

b)Emergence of Object Oriented Programming
emerged around 1980s to 1990s
it focuses on creation of objects
it combine both data and functions to manipulate the data
the key principles are:
inheritance- its acquring behaviours and properties from another  class
polymorphism-it is about using the same method name but with different behaviours depending on object calling it
encapulsations-hiding the internal workings of an object and only exposing what necessary
abstraction- its about hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features to the user
it led to better software reuse and made it easy to maintain
it also formed a basis for modern programming languages such as java, c++, python
C)Agile software development revolution
it was developed in 1990s till now(present)
it was developed in response to slow waterfall methodology
agile software development priotized flexibility, iterative development that fostered collaboration and its responsive to changes 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This is where information is gathered and users needs and requirements are documented.it is done through interviews,observations, surveys, questionares
Design: create a detailed design of high level of software archictecture and user interface. where actual design is done
Implementation: write code and build software inaccordance with design specification
Test: test the software to ensure it meets all quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: relase the software to the end-users
Maintain: update the software incase need arises


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology
it uses linear and  sequential approach where one cannot go to the next phase/step without attending to the first one and it predictable and structured wheras
Agile methodology
uses iterative and incremental approach making it more flexible and adaptable
In waterfall methodologies there is extensive planning done before the project begins whereas in Agile the planning is evolutionary
Example of a scenario of waterfall methodology
where the requirements are clear and unlikely to change and have fixed budget and  deadline
for instance in building a physical structure must follow a sequential order
Example of a scenario of an Agile methodology
where the requirements are unclear and likely to change and where collaboration and continous improvement is needed
for instance in web application


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software Developer ensures writes codes and implements software solutions
a quality Assurance Engineer ensures  software quality by designing and excuting test plans
a project manager oversees the planning, excution, and delivery of software projects
software engineering team


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
